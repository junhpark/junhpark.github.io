### My name is ***Junhyeok Park***. 

I love playing musical instriument, especially guitar :) 

I am a member of "De Colores" band group. 

We perform every month at Cartel Coffee or Sky Bar @ Tucson.


What I love is..

- playing guitar and having a small concert
- digging for new things! Right now, I indulge in control with small sensors and gadgets like Arduino!
- rock (both music and geology)
- traveling around great great mother nature
- my beautiful girlfriend, she is a biomedical researcher! I am proud of her :)


Whoa, what else do you need?
